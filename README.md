# Online-Store-App
A React Native e-commerce application for browsing products, managing a shopping cart, and placing orders.

This project started as a guided learning exercise using a YouTube tutorial to understand React Native and Supabase integration. 
I extended it independently by adding features such as cart management, order tracking, and custom UI components, and structured the app to be a clean, reusable codebase.

Features:
- User Authentication (sign up, log in, log out)
- Browse Products by category
- Add to Cart and manage items
- View Orders and order history
- Powered by Supabase backend

Tech Stack:
- React Native (TypeScript)
- Expo
- Supabase (auth + backend)
- State Management with custom store
- Modern UI Components

Goals of This Project:
- Learn React Native & TypeScript
- Practice authentication & API usage
- Build a portfolio project for CS internships

Future Improvements
- Implement payment system
- Add product reviews
- Dark mode support
- Deploy backend with more robust database
